* how to do inits?
- either:
  - change initializer_op
    - cons
      - relies on implementation details
      - might break with weird partition stuff
  - use initializer
    - cons
      - ugly interface (w/ metadata)
        - variable isn't created yet
  - different step to initialize
    - cons
      - harder to do conditional initialization
        - eg. orth init only for RNN matrix
      - additional step
- solution
  - use initializer
  - pass in metadata as dict instead
* extended graph
- either:
  - make graph wrapper
  - use existing graph and add attributes
- to store graph + extra state
  - eg.
    - metadata
    - state for specific tricks
      - eg. step counter for gradnets
- solution:
  - make graph wrapper
